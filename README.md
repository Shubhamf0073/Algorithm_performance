## Introduction
This project explores different regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression. It covers aspects like data generation, preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into several modules:
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Generates synthetic data for regression tasks.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Performs feature scaling.
- `models.py`: Contains functions to train regression models.
- `model_selection.py`: Selects the best-performing model based on cross-validation.
- `parameter_tuning.py`: Tunes hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.
- `cross_validation.py`: Performs cross-validation for model evaluation.
- `plot.py`: Provides functions for result visualization.
- `evaluation_metrics.py`: Calculates regression evaluation metrics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shubhamf0073/MlAlgo.git
    cd MlAlgo
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. View the generated logs in the project directory.

## Results
The project demonstrates the performance of various regression algorithms on synthetic data. Results include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and other evaluation metrics.
